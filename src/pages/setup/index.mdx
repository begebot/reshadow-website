# Setup

In order to start using `reshadow` you only need `Babel` which you most likely already use(for transpiling `JSX` syntax or your code for older browsers). You can also delegate styles processing to `PostCSS`. And extract them into separate files with the provided webpack loader. Please read below.

## Macro

If you use [CRA 2](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (Create React App) or [babel-plugin-macros](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros). You can use `reshadow/macro` and it will work out of the box.

```js
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'reshadow/macro';

export const Button = ({children}) =>
    styled`
    button {
        /* button styles */
    }
`(<button>{children}</button>);
```

Options (via [babel-plugin-macros config](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/blob/master/other/docs/author.md#config-experimental)) are the same as `reshadow` [babel options](#babel-options), but with different defaults:

| option  | default value     |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| postcss | true              |
| files   | /\.shadow\.css\$/ |

## Babel

Babel is a bare minimum to start using `reshadow`. Add `reshadow/babel` to the plugin list. Now your styles will be handled by babel. They will end up in your javascript bundle and will be appended to the `<head>` tag of your html page when loaded.

`babel.config.js`

```js
module.exports = {
    plugins: ['reshadow/babel'],
};
```

### Options

| option          | type                           | default value | description                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| postcss         | boolean \| {plugins: Plugin[]} | false         | Use PostCSS to process CSS code. You can add your custom PostCSS plugins (they should be sync) |
| files           | boolean \| RegExp              | false         | Resolve and process `css` files imports that match to the RegExp                               |
| elementFallback | boolean \| string              | 'div'         | Use fallback for the custom elements                                                           |

## PostCSS

If you want to delegate styles processing to [`PostCSS`](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) to take advantage of many things such as [`autoprefixer`](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) you need to add `reshadow/postcss` to the `PostCSS` plugin list.

`postcss.config.js`

```js
module.exports = {
    plugins: ['reshadow/postcss'],
};
```

## Webpack

To extract styles into separate CSS files you need to add the `reshadow` webpack loader - `reshadow/webpack/loader`.

_webpack.config.js_

```js
{
    test: /\.js$/,
    use: [
        'reshadow/webpack/loader',
        'babel-loader',
    ]
}
```
