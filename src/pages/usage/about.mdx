# Motivation

The idea of **reshadow** came from the needs to develop the Design System, which includes the implementation of a lot of complex components, with different states, styles, experiments and themes.
The main purpose of **reshadow** creation was an attempt to simplify the way how to style such complex components and systems.

And what could be simplier than just... global styles? ðŸ˜„

Let's say we have a `button`, and we want to style it. The easiest way to do that is something like:

```css
button {
    /* button styles */
}
```
```js
<button>click me</button>
```

It is also very clear how to style, for example, `disabled` button:

```css
button[disabled] {
    pointer-events: none;
    opacity: .4;
}
```
```js
<button disabled>click me</button>
```

But, of course nowadays we have a lot of [problems](/about/problems) with global styles, so we need to use abstractions like `BEM`, `css-modules` and so on.
We also have `Shadow DOM`, which can fix some kind of that problems like incapsulation, but there are also [many tradeoffs](/about/shadow-dom), and it often doesn't fit to the requirements.

As a result, **reshadow** created to solve these problems, in components era.
It is possible to write HTML and CSS, but for Virtual DOM, like there is nothing else than just the Component.

<Editor filename={__filename}>{{
    files: {
        './styles.css': `

            button {
                font-size: 16px;
                cursor: pointer;
                padding: 10px 15px;
                border-radius: 20px;
                border: 2px solid;
                color: rebeccapurple;
            }

            button[disabled] {
                cursor: not-allowed;
                opacity: .4;

                & content {
                    pointer-events: none;
                }
            }
        `
    },
    code: [
        `
            import styles from './styles.css'

            const Button = ({bgcolor, children, ...props}) => styled(styles)(
                <button {...props}>
                    <content>{children}</content>
                </button>
            );
        `,
        `
            <Button>
                click me
            </Button>
        `,
    ]
}}
</Editor>
