# Main Concepts

**reshadow** has two basic concepts: *elements* and *modifiers*. It looks similar to the **BEM**, and yes, it is. But let's take a break from **BEM** and get to the bottom of it.

Take a look on this example:

```css
button[disabled] {
    pointer-events: none;
    opacity: .4;
}
```
```js
<button disabled>click me</button>
```

The state of the application here presented by the **element** `button` and the button's state, described by **modifier** `disabled`. So yeah, we can describe the web application presentation in terms of elements and modifiers:
- element - `HTML` element
- modifier - element attributes

And you can easily match styles to this state, just by matching on the element and its modifier, like in the example above.

There are no conventions and abstractions, it's just how `HTML` and `CSS` works. With **reshadow**, we have an intention to build complex UIs, based on basic ideas and strong specification, which exists more than a dozen years.

So, back to BEM, in terms of **reshadow** it could be presented by:
- **B**lock - Component
- **E**lement - Component's presentational elements (mark up)
- **M**odifiers - Component's props and its' elements attributes

## elements

## props and modifiers

## `as` prop
