**reshadow** has two basic concepts: *elements* and *modifiers*. It looks similar to the **BEM**, and yes, it is. But let's take a break from **BEM** and get to the bottom of it.

Take a look on this example:

```css
button[disabled] {
    pointer-events: none;
    opacity: .4;
}
```
```js
<button disabled>click me</button>
```

Application's state here was presented by the `button` **element**'s state using `disabled` **modifier**. So yeah, we can describe the web application presentation in terms of elements and modifiers:
- element - `HTML` element,
- modifier - element attributes.

And you can easily match styles to the application's state, just by writing CSS selectors on the element and its modifiers, like in the example above.

There are no additional conventions and abstractions, it's just the way `HTML` and `CSS` works. With **reshadow**, we have an intention to build complex UIs, based on basic ideas and strong specification, which exists more than a dozen years.

So, back to BEM, in terms of **reshadow** it could be presented by:
- **B**lock - Component,
- **E**lement - Component's presentational elements (mark up),
- **M**odifiers - Component's props and its elements' attributes.

## props and modifiers

## `as` prop
