**reshadow** has two basic concepts: _elements_ and _modifiers_. It looks similar to the **BEM**, and yes, it is. But let's take a break from BEM and get to the bottom of it.

Take a look at this example:

```css
button[disabled] {
    pointer-events: none;
    opacity: 0.4;
}
```

```js
<button disabled>click me</button>
```

Application's state here was presented by the `button` **element**'s state using `disabled` **modifier**. So yeah, we can describe the web application presentation in terms of elements and modifiers:

-   element - `HTML` element,
-   modifier - element attributes.

And you can easily match styles to the application's state, just by writing CSS selectors on the element and its modifiers, like in the example above.

There are no additional conventions and abstractions, it's just the way `HTML` and `CSS` works. With **reshadow**, we have an intention to build complex UIs, based on basic ideas and strong specification, which exists more than a dozen years.

So, back to BEM, in terms of **reshadow** it could be presented by:

-   **B**lock - Component,
-   **E**lement - Component's presentational elements (mark up),
-   **M**odifiers - Component's props and its elements' attributes.

## elements

Let's consider an abstract simplified part of mark up:

```js
<div className={styles.container}>
    <div className={styles.tooltip}>
        <div className={styles.content}>{this.props.children}</div>

        <span className={styles.tail} />
    </div>
</div>
```

Leaving aside the issue of quality of that code, `a11y` problems and so on, there is also a problem to read and understand this code. It's not clear, what is the **semantic** mark up of this Component, how it was decomposed, how you can also style it on your own.

In fact, this mark up is presented by these elements:

-   container
-   tooltip
-   content
-   tail

It's important to note, that **elements** are not required to be necessary `HTML` elements. These elements are highlighted semantically.

With **reshadow** the part above might look like:

```js
<container>
    <tooltip>
        <content>{this.props.children}</content>

        <tail as="span" />
    </tooltip>
</container>
```

By default, for elements, that are not supported by the `web platform`, **reshadow** uses fallback to the `div` element (you can change this option in [babel options](/setup#babel)).

Thus, **reshadow** brings semantics to the fore, and it's more about _how your component semantically presented_.

So, the mark up above could be styled this way:

> **reshadow** will automatically match the elements and styles, so you don't need to match any of them by hands (like in native `CSS` and `HTML` ðŸ˜‰)

```css
container {
    display: flex;
    /* container styles */
}

content {
    /* content styles */
}

/* other elements styles */
```

### `as` attribute

It is also possible to apply `as` attribute for any kind of elements to force an element to be presented in DOM as specified.

```js
/* it would be <span>my content<span> in DOM */

<content as="span">my content</content>
```

## props and modifiers

Any element or Component declares its own interface, which could be named as `props` in `React` way. So **reshadow** determines `props` and `modifiers` as follows:

-   Props - a part of the Component's or element's interface
-   Modifier - a property, that you need to set to style the element or Component, but this property was not declared by the interface.

For example, let's consider the `button` element. You can pass the `disabled` attribute to the button, and this is a part of its interface. But what if you want to set `button`'s `size`? In terms of **reshadow** `disabled` would be the **prop**, and `size` - **modifier**.

**reshadow** allows setting modifiers with the `use` namespace.

```js
/**
 * disabled - prop
 * use:size - modifier 'size' with value 's'
 **/

<button disabled use:size="s">
    click me
</button>

<Button disabled use:size="s">
    click me
</Button>
```

It is also possible to use the function `use` instead of jsx-namespaces:

```js
import {use} from 'reshadow';

<button disabled {...use({size: 's'})}>
    click me
</button>

<Button disabled {...use({size: 's'})}>
    click me
</Button>
```

All modifiers will be cut with the **reshadow**, so they won't be passed to the element or Component.

Both examples will correspond to the following styles:

```css
button[disabled] {
    /* styles for the disabled button */
}

button[use|size='s'] {
    /* styles for the button with size: m */
}
```

For the `Button` Component:

```css
Button[disabled] {
    /* the same for the Button Component */
}

Button[use|size='s'] {
    /* the same for the Button Component with size: m */
}
```

It is also possible to use syntax-sugar for modifiers (omit the `use` namespace):

```css
button[|size='m'] {
    /* styles for the button with size: m */
}
```

And you can also use syntax-sugar for pattern-matching for the attributes:

```css
button[type] {
    &='submit' {
        /* styles for the [type="submit"] */
    }

    &=reset {
        /* styles for the [type=reset] */
    }
}

button[|size] {
    &='s' {
        /* styles for the [use|size="s"] */
    }

    &=m {
        /* styles for the [use|size=m] */
    }
}
```
